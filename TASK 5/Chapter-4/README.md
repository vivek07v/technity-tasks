1. [] refers to an empty list value.

2. spam[2] = 'hello'

3. spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluates to 'd'

4. spam[-1] evaluates to 'd'. (Negative index count from end)

5. ['a', 'b']

6. bacon.index('cat') prints the index of 'cat'. So it evaluates to 1.

7. bacon.append(99) makes the list bacon looks like [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. bacon.remove('cat') makes the list bacon looks like [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]

9. Operator for list concatenation is '+'. Operator for replecation is '*'.

10. append() will only add values to the end of the list, while insert() can add anywhere in the list(index should be specified by user)

11. del statement and remove() method are the two ways to remove values from the list.

12. Both lists and strings can be concatenated and replicated. length of the lists and string can be found by using len() method. they both have indexes and slices.

13. Lists are mutable whereas tuplets are immutable. Lists uses square brackets whereas tuplets uses parentheses.

14. (42,)

15. we can get the tuple form of a list value by tuple() function and we can get the list form of a tuple value by list() function.

16. They contain references to list values.

17. copy.copy(), can be used to make a duplicate copy of a mutable value like a list or dictionary, not just a copy of a reference whereas copy.deepcopy() will copy inner lists as well.
