1. Whenever a group of code is to be executed several times, functions can be used. Function reduce the need for duplicate code. This improves the code reusability and readbility. It enhances the efficiency of the code.

2. The code in a function will be executed when the function is called. it does not execute when function is defined.

3. def statement is used to create a function.

4. A function is like a recipe that describes a specific task or action in a program. It contains a set of instructions for the computer to follow. A function call, on the other hand, is when you actually use that recipe in your program. It's like telling the computer to execute the instructions defined in the function.

5. There is only one global scope in python program. For local scopes, there can be multiple instances. Each time a function is called, a new local scope is created for that function's variables. 

6. When a function returns, the local scope created for that function will be destroyed, and all the variables in that local scope will be erased.

7. A return value is the value that a function returns to the caller when the function is executed. Return value can be a part of an expression.

8. If there is no return statement in function, the function will automatically return a special value called 'None'.

9. To force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable, you can use the global keyword before the variable name.

    global variable_name

10. The data type of None is 'NoneType'.

11. That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic if exists.

12. using spam.bacon()

13. To prevent a program from crashing when it encounters an error, we can implement error handling mechanisms using exception handling. We should place the lines which might cause error in try clause and the error message in except clause.

14. The lines that might cause error goes in to try clause and the error message that should be displayed when error occurs should be gone into except clause.
